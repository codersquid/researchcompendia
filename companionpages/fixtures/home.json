    "answer": "ResearchCompendia follows three main objectives:\r\n\r\n* The first objective is to allow researchers to quickly disseminate internationally the results of their research, which will considerably increase the potential of citations of scientific papers.\r\n* The second objective is to provide a very large community of users with the ability to use the latest  scientific methods in a user-friendly environment. This will speed up the process of converting scientific results into productive forces.\r\n* The third objective is to allow members of the academic community (researchers, editors, referees,  etc.) to replicate scientific results and to demonstrate their robustness. Thus, ResearchCompendia constitutes a revolutionary scientific validation tool.",
