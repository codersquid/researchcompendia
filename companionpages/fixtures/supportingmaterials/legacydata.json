    "abstract": "We consider pooling cross-section time series data for testing the unit root hypothesis. The degree of persistence in individual regression error, the intercept and trend coefficient are allowed to vary freely across individuals. As both the cross-section and time series dimensions of the panel grow large, the pooled t-statistic has a limiting normal distribution that depends on the regression specification but is free from nuisance parameters. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the asymptotic results provide a good approximation to the test statistics in panels of moderate size, and that the power of the panel-based unit root test is dramatically higher, compared to performing a separate unitroottest for each individual time series.",

    "abstract": "Bank credit to the private sector fell as a share to GDP during the last decade, in spite of a successful bank recapitalization in the middle of the 2000s and high and stable growth before the recent macroeconomic turmoil. This paper explains this trend based on both bank supply factors and demand for credit from the private sector. First the paper describes the evolution of the banks\u2019 sources and uses of funds in the period 2005-2011, characterized by two different cycles of external capital flows. Then it estimates supply and demand equations of credit to the private sector, using quarterly data for the period 1999-2011. First, the system of simultaneous equations is estimated assuming continuous market clearing. Then the system is estimated allowing for transitory disequilibrium. In general, the main results are robust to the market clearing assumption. Our main findings show that, while real industrial production and the stock market have a significant impact on credit demand, deposits and claims on government affected the supply of credit in Egypt. Finally, both models yield similar results for the most recent period of private credit contraction: the single most important factor explaining the largest share of the decline is the expansion of banking credit to the public sector. The slowdown in economic activity and the contraction of bank deposits explain the remainder of the predicted contraction in bank credit to the private sector.",

    "title": "A Comparative Study of Unit Root Tests with Panel Data and a New Simple Test", 
    "abstract": "The panel data unit root test suggested by Levin and Lin (LL) has been widely used in several applications, notably in papers on tests of the purchasing power parity hypothesis. This test is based on a very restrictive hypothesis which is rarely ever of interest in practice. The Im\u2013Pesaran\u2013Shin (IPS) test relaxes the restrictive assumption of the LL test. This paper argues that although the IPS test has been offered as a generalization of the LL test, it is best viewed as a test for summarizing the evidence from a number of independent tests of the sample hypothesis. This problem has a long statistical history going back to R. A. Fisher. This paper suggests the Fisher test as a panel data unit root test, compares it with the LL and IPS tests, and the Bonferroni bounds test which is valid for correlated tests. Overall, the evidence points to the Fisher test with bootstrap-based critical values as the preferred choice. We also suggest the use of the Fisher test for testing stationarity as the null and also in testing for cointegration in panel data.",

    "title": "Unit Root Tests for Panel Data", 
    "abstract": "This paper develops unit root tests for panel data. These tests are devised under more general assumptions than the tests previously proposed. First, the number of groups in the panel data is assumed to be either finite or infinite. Second, each group is assumed to have different types of nonstochastic and stochastic components. Third, the time series spans for the groups are assumed to be all different. Fourth, the alternative where some groups have a unit root and others do not can be dealt with by the tests. The tests can also be used for the null of stationarity and for cointegration, once relevant changes are made in the model, hypotheses, assumptions and underlying tests. The main idea for our unit root tests is to combine p-values from a unit root test applied to each group in the panel data. Combining p-values to formulate tests is a common practice in meta-analysis. This paper also reports the finite sample performance of our combination unit root tests and Im et al.'s [Mimeo (1995)] t-bar test. The results show that most of the combination tests are more powerful than the t-bar test in finite samples. Application of the combination unit root tests to the post-Bretton Woods US real exchange rate data provides some evidence in favor of the PPP hypothesis.",

In particular it proposes a standardized t-bar test statistic based on the (augmented) Dickey\u2013Fuller statistics averaged across the groups. Under a general setting this statistic is shown to converge in probability to a standard normal variate sequentially with T (the time series dimension) \u2192\u221e, followed by N (the cross sectional dimension) \u2192\u221e. A diagonal convergence result with T and N\u2192\u221e while N/T\u2192k,k being a finite non-negative constant, is also conjectured. In the special case where errors in individual Dickey\u2013Fuller (DF) regressions are serially uncorrelated a modified version of the standardized t-bar statistic is shown to be distributed as standard normal as N\u2192\u221e for a fixed T, so long as T>5 in the case of DF regressions with intercepts and T>6 in the case of DF regressions with intercepts and linear time trends. An exact fixed N and T test is also developed using the simple average of the DF statistics. Monte Carlo results show that if a large enough lag order is selected for the underlying ADF regressions, then the small sample performances of the t-bar test is reasonably satisfactory and generally better than the test proposed by Levin and Lin (Unpublished manuscript, University of California, San Diego, 1993).",

    "abstract": "This paper studies testing for a unit root for large n and T panels in which the cross-sectional units are correlated. To model this cross-sectional correlation, we assume that the data are generated by an unknown number of unobservable common factors. We propose unit root tests in this environment and derive their (Gaussian) asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of a unit root and local alternatives. We show that these tests have significant asymptotic power when the model has no incidental trends. However, when there are incidental trends in the model and it is necessary to remove heterogeneous deterministic components, we show that these tests have no power against the same local alternatives. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we provide evidence on the finite sample properties of these new tests.",

    "title": "Stable Recovery of Sparse Overcomplete Representations in the Presence of Noise", 
    "abstract": "Overcomplete representations are attracting interest in signal processing theory, particularly due to their potential to generate sparse representations of signals. However, in general, the problem of finding sparse representations must be unstable in the presence of noise. This paper establishes the possibility of stable recovery under a combination of sufficient sparsity and favorable structure of the overcomplete system. Considering an ideal underlying signal that has a sufficiently sparse representation, it is assumed that only a noisy version of it can be observed. Assuming further that the overcomplete system is incoherent, it is shown that the optimally sparse approximation to the noisy data differs from the optimally sparse decomposition of the ideal noiseless signal by at most a constant multiple of the noise level. As this optimal-sparsity method requires heavy (combinatorial) computational effort, approximation algorithms are considered. It is shown that similar stability is also available using the basis and the matching pursuit algorithms. Furthermore, it is shown that these methods result in sparse approximation of the noisy data that contains only terms also appearing in the unique sparsest representation of the ideal noiseless sparse signal.",

    "abstract": "We propose a framework for out-of-sample predictive ability testing and forecast selection designed for use in the realistic situation in which the forecasting model is possibly misspecified, due to unmodeled dynamics, unmodeled heterogeneity, incorrect functional form, or any combination of these. Relative to the existing literature (Diebold and Mariano (1995) and West (1996)), we introduce two main innovations: (i) We derive our tests in an environment where the finite sample properties of the estimators on which the forecasts may depend are preserved asymptotically. (ii) We accommodate conditional evaluation objectives (can we predict which forecast will be more accurate at a future date?), which nest unconditional objectives (which forecast was more accurate on average?), that have been the sole focus of previous literature. As a result of (i), our tests have several advantages: they capture the effect of estimation uncertainty on relative forecast performance, they can handle forecasts based on both nested and nonnested models, they allow the forecasts to be produced by general estimation methods, and they are easy to compute. Although both unconditional and conditional approaches are informative, conditioning can help fine-tune the forecast selection to current economic conditions. To this end, we propose a two-step decision rule that uses current information to select the best forecast for the future date of interest. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by comparing forecasts from leading parameter-reduction methods for macroeconomic forecasting using a large number of predictors.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates model checks for a class of possibly nonlinear heteroskedastic time series models, including but not restricted to ARMA-GARCH models. We propose omnibus tests based on functionals of certain weighted standardized residual empirical processes. The new tests are asymptotically distribution-free, suitable when the conditioning set is infinite-dimensional, and consistent against a class of Pitman\u2019s local alternatives converging at the parametric rate n-1/2, with n the sample size. A Monte Carlo study shows that the simulated level of the proposed tests is close to the asymptotic level already for moderate sample sizes and that tests have a satisfactory power performance. Finally, we illustrate our methodology with an application to the well-known S&P 500 daily stock index. The paper also contains an asymptotic uniform expansion for weighted residual empirical processes when initial conditions are considered, a result of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Given a signal S ( R^N and a full-rank matrix D ( R^NL with N<L, we define the signal\u2019s over-complete representation as a ( R^L satisfying S=Da. Among the infinitely many solutions of this under-determined linear system of equations, we have special interest in the sparsest representation, i.e., the one minimizing ||a||0. This problem has a combinatorial flavor to it, and its direct solution is impossible even for moderate L. Approximation algorithms are thus required, and one such appealing technique is the basis pursuit (BP) algorithm. This algorithm has been the focus of recent theoretical research effort. It was found that if indeed the representation is sparse enough, BP finds it accurately. When an error is permitted in the composition of the signal, we no longer require exact equality S=Da. The BP has been extended to treat this case, leading to a denoizing algorithm. The natural question to pose is how the abovementioned theoretical results generalize to this more practical mode of operation. In this paper we propose such a generalization. The behavior of the basis pursuit in the presence of noise has been the subject of two independent very wide contributions released for publication very recently. This paper is another contribution in this direction, but as opposed to the others mentioned, this paper aims to present a somewhat simplified picture of the topic, and thus could be referred to as a primer to this field. Specifically, we establish here the stability of the BP in the presence of noise for sparse enough representations. We study both the case of a general dictionary D, and a special case where D is built as a union of orthonormal bases. This work is a direct generalization of noiseless BP study, and indeed, when the noise power is reduced to zero, we obtain the known results of the noiseless BP.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new tool for backtesting that examines the quality of Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts. To date, the most distinguished regression-based backtest, proposed by Engle and Manganelli (2004), relies on a linear model. However, in view of the dichotomic character of the series of violations, a non-linear model seems more appropriate. In this paper we thus propose a new tool for backtesting (denoted DB) based on a dynamic binary regression model. Our discrete-choice model, e.g. Probit, Logit, links the sequence of violations to a set of explanatory variables including the lagged VaR and thelagged violations in particular. It allows us to separately test the unconditional coverage, the independence and the conditional coverage hypotheses and it is easy to implement. Monte-Carlo experiments show that the DB test exhibits good small sample properties in realistic sample settings (5% coverage rate with estimation risk). An application on a portfolio composed of three assets included in the CAC40 market index is finally proposed.",

    "title": "Sparse Nonnegative Solution of Underdetermined Linear Equations by Linear Programming ", 
    "abstract": "Consider an underdetermined system of linear equations y = Ax with known d*n matrix A and known y. We seek the sparsest nonnegative solution, i.e. the nonnegative x with fewest nonzeros satisfying y = Ax. In general this problem is NP-hard. However, for many matrices A there is a threshold phenomenon: if the sparsest solution is sufficiently sparse, it can be found by linear programming. In classical convex polytope theory, a polytope P is called k-neighborly if every set of k vertices of P span a face of P. Let aj denote the j-th column of A, 1<=_j<=_n, let a0 = 0 and let P denote the convex hull of the aj . We say P is outwardly k-neighborly if every subset of k vertices not including 0 spans a face of P. We show that outward k-neighborliness is completely equivalent to the statement that, whenever y = Ax has a nonnegative solution with at most k nonzeros, it is the nonnegative solution to y = Ax having minimal sum. Using this and classical results on polytope neighborliness we obtain two types of corollaries. First, because many [d/2]-neighborly polytopes are known, there are many systems where the sparsest solution is available by convex optimization rather than combinatorial optimization - provided the answer has fewer nonzeros than half the number of equations. We mention examples involving incompletely-observed Fourier transforms and Laplace transforms. Second, results on classical neighborliness of high-dimensional randomly-projected simplices imply that, if A is a typical uniformly-distributed random orthoprojector with n = 2d and n large, the sparsest nonnegative solution to y = Ax can be found by linear programming provided it has fewer nonzeros than 1/8 the number of equations. We also consider a notion of weak neighborliness, in which the overwhelming majority of k-sets of aj's not containing 0 span a face. This implies that most nonnegative vectors x with k nonzeros are uniquely determined by y = Ax. As a corollary of recent work counting faces of random simplices, it is known that most polytopes P generated by large n by 2n uniformly-distributed orthoprojectors A are weakly k-neighborly with k _~.558n. We infer that for most n by 2n underdetermined systems having a sparse solution with fewer nonzeros than roughly half the number of equations, the sparsest solution can be found by linear programming.",

    "title": "Why Simple Shrinkage is Still Relevant for Redundant Representations?", 
    "abstract": "Shrinkage is a well known and appealing denoising technique, introduced originally by Donoho and Johnstone in 1994. The use of shrinkage for denoising is known to be optimal for Gaussian white noise, provided that the sparsity on the signal\u2019s representation is enforced using a unitary transform. Still, shrinkage is also practiced with non-unitary, and even redundant representations, typically leading to very satisfactory results. In this paper we shed some light on this behavior. The main argument in this paper is that such simple shrinkage could be interpreted as the first iteration of an algorithm that solves the basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) problem. While the desired solution of BPDN is hard to obtain in general, we develop in this paper a simple iterative procedure for the BPDN minimization that amounts to step-wise shrinkage. We demonstrate how the simple shrinkage emerges as the first iteration of this novel algorithm. Furthermore, we show how shrinkage can be iterated, turning into an effective algorithm that minimizes the BPDN via simple shrinkage steps, in order to further strengthen the denoising effect.",

It has recently been shown that properties of the centrosymmetric polytope P = AC are of interest for finding sparse solutions to the underdetermined system of equations y = Ax; [9]. In particular, it is valuable to know that P is centrally k-neighborly. We study the face numbers of randomly-projected cross-polytopes in the proportional dimensional case where dn, where the projector A is chosen uniformly at random from the Grassmann manifold of d-dimensional orthoprojectors of Rn. We derive ?N(d) > 0 with the property that, for any ? < ?N(d), with overwhelming probability for large d, the number of k-dimensional faces of P = AC is the same as for C, for 0 k d. This implies that P is centrally bdc-neighborly, and its skeleton Skel[? d](P) is combinatorially equivalent to Skel[? d]\u00a9. We display graphs of ?N. Two weaker notions of neighborliness are also important for understanding sparse solutions of linear equations: facial neighborliness and sectional neighborliness [9]; we study both. The weakest, (k, e)-facial neighborliness, asks if the k-faces are all simplicial and if the numbers of k-dimensional faces fk(P) >= fk(C)(1 - e). We characterize and compute the critical proportion ?F (d) > 0 at which phase transition occurs in k/d. The other, (k, e)- sectional neighborliness, asks whether all, except for a small fraction epsilon, of the k-dimensional intrinsic sections of P are k-dimensional cross-polytopes. (Intrinsic sections intersect P with k-dimensional subspaces spanned by vertices of P.) We characterize and compute a proportion ?S(d) > 0 guaranteeing this property for k/d ~ ? < ?S(d).

    "abstract": "This paper reconsiders the degree to which the signpatterns of hypothesized structural arrays limit the possible outcomes for the signpattern of the corresponding estimated reducedform. The conditions under which any structuralrestrictions would apply were believed to be very narrow, rarely found to apply, and virtually never investigated. As a result, current practice does not test the structural hypothesis in terms of the comparison of the estimated reducedform and the permissible reducedformsignpatterns. This paper shows that such tests are always possible. Namely, that the signpatterns of the hypothesized structural arrays always limit the signpatterns that can be taken on by the estimated reducedform. Given this, it is always possible to falsify a structural hypothesis based only upon the signpattern proposed. Necessary conditions, algorithmic principles, and examples are provided to illustrate the analytic principle and the means of its application.",

Using various proxies for product market competition, and reductions of import tariff rates to capture exogenous changes to a firm's competitive environment, I find that competition has a significantly positive effect on the cost of bank debt. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the effect of competition is greater in industries in which small firms face financially strong rivals, in industries with intense strategic interactions between firms, and in illiquid industries. Overall, these findings suggest that banks price financial contracts by taking into account the risk that arises from product market competition.",

The most commonly studied case is with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), where the observed noisy image f is related to the underlying true image u by f = u + \u03b7, and \u03b7 is at each point in space independently and identically distributed as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable. Total variation (TV) regularization is a technique that was originally developed for AWGN image denoising by Rudin, Osher, and Fatemi. The TV regularization technique has since been applied to a multitude of other imaging problems, see for example Chan and Shen's book. We focus here on the split Bregman algorithm of Goldstein and Osher for TV-regularized denoising.",

    "abstract": "We report strong OLS and instrumental variable evidence that an overall corporate governance index is an important and likely causal factor in explaining the market value of Korean public companies. We construct a corporate governance index (KCGI, 0~100) for 515 Korean companies based on a 2001 Korea Stock Exchange survey. In OLS, a worst-to-best change in KCGIpredicts a 0.47 increase in Tobin's q (about a 160% increase in share price). This effect is statistically strong (t = 6.12) and robust to choice of market value variable (Tobin's q, market/book, and market/sales), specification of the governance index, and inclusion of extensive control variables. We rely on unique features of Korean legal rules to construct an instrument for KCGI. Good instruments are not available in other comparable studies. Two-stage and three-stage least squares coefficients are larger than OLS coefficients and are highly significant. Thus, this paper offers evidence consistent with a causal relationship between an overall governance index and higher share prices in emerging markets. We also find that Korean firms with 50% outside directors have 0.13 higher Tobin's q (roughly 40% higher share price), after controlling for the rest of KCGI. This effect, too, is likely causal. Thus, we report the first evidence consistent with greater board independence causally predicting higher share prices in emerging markets.",

The difference in performance may be espe- cially important in estimating quantities that depend on tail features, including risk measures such as the expected shortfall. Here, using a recent generalization of the asymmetric Student-t distribution to allow separate parameters to control skewness and the thickness of each tail, we fit daily financial returns and forecast expected shortfall for the S&P 500 index and a number of individual company stocks; the generalized distribution is used for the standardized innovations in a nonlinear, asymmetric GARCH-type model. The results provide empirical evidence for the usefulness of the generalized distribution in improving prediction of downside market risk of financial assets.",

Global convergence of the algorithm is proven in the case that the order of approximation is one and in the case that the spectrum encloses a starlike region. Examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm even when these conditions are not satisfied.",

    "abstract": "In the olfactory bulb, both the spatial distribution and the temporal structure of neuronal activity appear to be important for processing odor information, but it is currently impossible to measure both of these simultaneously with high resolution and in all layers of the bulb. We have developed a biologically realistic model of the mammalian olfactory bulb, incorporating the mitral and granule cells and the dendrodendritic synapses between them, which allows us to observe the network behavior in detail. The cell models were based on previously published work. The attributes of the synapses were obtained from the literature. The pattern of synaptic connections was based on the limited experimental data in the literature on the statistics of connections between neurons in the bulb. The results of simulation experiments with electrical stimulation agree closely in most details with published experimental data. This gives confidence that the model is capturing features of network interactions in the real olfactory bulb. The model predicts that the time course of dendrodendritic inhibition is dependent on the network connectivity as well as on the intrinsic parameters of the synapses. In response to simulated odor stimulation, strongly activated mitral cells tend to suppress neighboring cells, the mitral cells readily synchronize their firing, and increasing the stimulus intensity increases the degree of synchronization. Preliminary experiments suggest that slow temporal changes in the degree of synchronization are more useful in distinguishing between very similar odorants than is the spatial distribution of mean firing rate.",

Second, they specify intermediate-frequency dynamics usually assigned to smooth autoregressive transitions. Finally, high-frequency switches generate substantial outliers. Thus a single mechanism captures three features that are typically viewed as distinct in the literature. Maximum-likelihood estimation is developed and performs well in finite samples. Using exchange rates, we estimate a version of the process with four parameters and more than a thousand states. The multifractal outperforms GARCH, MS-GARCH, and FIGARCH in- and out-of-sample. Considerable gains in forecasting accuracy are obtained at horizons of 10 to 50 days.",

For random matrices with Gaussian i.i.d entries, it is known that, when x0 is k-sparse, there is a precisely determined phase transition: for a certain region in the (k/n, n/N )-phase diagram, convex optimization min ||x||_1 subject to y = Ax, x \u2208 X^N typically \ufb01nds the sparsest solution, while outside that region, it typically fails.

We consider speci\ufb01c deterministic matrices including Spikes and Sines, Spikes and Noiselets, Paley Frames, Delsarte-Goethals Frames, Chirp Sensing Matrices, and Grassmannian Frames. Extensive experiments show that for a typical k-sparse object, convex optimization is successful over a region of the phase diagram that coincides with the region known for Gaussian matrices. In our experiments, we considered coef\ufb01cients constrained to X^N for four different sets X \u2208 {[0, 1], R_+ , R, C}. We establish this \ufb01nding for each of the associated four phase transitions.",

    "abstract": "Weakly electric knifefish are exceptionally maneuverable swimmers. In prior work, we have shown that they are able to move their entire body omnidirectionally so that they can rapidly reach prey up to several centimeters away. Consequently, in addition to being a focus of efforts to understand the neural basis of sensory signal processing in vertebrates, knifefish are increasingly the subject of biomechanical analysis to understand the coupling of signal acquisition and biomechanics. Here, we focus on a key subset of the knifefish's omnidirectional mechanical abilities: hovering in place, and swimming forward at variable speed. Using high-speed video and a markerless motion capture system to capture fin position, we show that hovering is achieved by generating two traveling waves, one from the caudal edge of the fin and one from the rostral edge, moving toward each other. These two traveling waves overlap at a nodal point near the center of the fin, cancelling fore-aft propulsion. During forward swimming at low velocities, the caudal region of the fin continues to have counter-propagating waves, directly retarding forward movement. The gait transition from hovering to forward swimming is accompanied by a shift in the nodal point toward the caudal end of the fin. While frequency varies significantly to increase speed at low velocities, beyond approximately one body length per second, the frequency stays near 10 Hz, and amplitude modulation becomes more prominent. A coupled central pattern generator model is able to reproduce qualitative features of fin motion and suggest hypotheses regarding the fin's neural control.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new tool for validating risk models. This tool, called the Risk Map, jointly accounts for the number and the magnitude of extreme losses and graphically summarizes all information about the performance of a risk model. It relies on the concept of Value-at-Risk (VaR) super exception, which is defined as a situation in which the loss exceeds both the standard VaR and a VaR defined at an extremely low coverage probability. We then formally test whether the sequences of exceptions and super exceptions is rejected by standard model validation tests. We show that the Risk Map can be used to validate market, credit, operational, or systemic (e.g. CoVaR) risk estimates or to assess the performance of the margin system of a clearing house.",

    "abstract": "Banks hold capital to guard against unexpected surges in losses and long freezes in financial markets. The minimum level of capital is set by banking regulators as a function of the banks\u2019 own estimates of their risk exposures. As a result, a great challenge for both banks and regulators is to validate internal risk models. We show that a large fraction of US and international banks uses contaminated data when testing their models. In particular, most banks validate their market risk model using profit-and-loss (P/L) data that include fees and commissions and intraday trading revenues. This practice is inconsistent with the definition of the employed market risk measure. Using both bank data and simulations, we find that data contamination has dramatic implications for model validation and can lead to the acceptance of misspecified risk models. Moreover, our estimates suggest that the use of contaminated data can significantly reduce (market-risk induced) regulatory capital.",

    "title": "Diversification and Value-at-Risk", 
    "abstract": "A pervasive and puzzling feature of banks\u2019 Value-at-Risk (VaR) is its abnormally high level, which leads to excessive regulatory capital. A possible explanation for the tendency of commercial banks to overstate their VaR is that they incompletely account for the diversification effect among broad risk categories (e.g., equity, interest rate, commodity, credit spread, and foreign exchange). By underestimating the diversification effect, bank\u2019s proprietary VaR models produce overly prudent market risk assessments. In this paper, we examine empirically the validity of this hypothesis using actual VaR data from major US commercial banks. In contrast to the VaR diversification hypothesis, we find that US banks show no sign of systematic underestimation of the diversification effect. In particular, diversification effects used by banks is very close to (and quite often larger than) our empirical diversification estimates. A direct implication of this finding is that individual VaRs for each broad risk category, just like aggregate VaRs, are biased risk assessments.",

To measure the level of VaR disclosures, we develop a VaR Disclosure Index that captures many different facets of market risk disclosure. Using panel data over the period 1996\u20132005, we find an overall upward trend in the quantity of information released to the public. We also find that Historical Simulation is by far the most popular VaR method. We assess the accuracy of VaR figures by studying the number of VaR exceedances and whether actual daily VaRs contain information about the volatility of subsequent trading revenues. Unlike the level of VaR disclosure, the quality of VaR disclosure shows no sign of improvement over time. We find that VaR computed using Historical Simulation contains very little information about future volatility.",

These forecast methods are traditionally evaluated by means of the unconditional backtest. This paper formally shows that the unconditional backtest is always inconsistent for backtesting HS and FHS models, with a power function that can be even smaller than the nominal level in large samples. Our findings have fundamental implications in the determination of market risk capital requirements, and also explain Monte Carlo and empirical findings in previous studies. We also propose a data-driven weighted backtest with good power properties to evaluate HS and FHS forecasts. A Monte Carlo study and an empirical application with three US stocks confirm our theoretical findings. The empirical application shows that multiplication factors computed under the current regulatory framework are downward biased, as they inherit the inconsistency of the unconditional backtest.",

This formula is obtained under a symmetry assumption on the linear innovation process. It is illustrated on ARMA\u2013GARCH models and compared to the standard formula.

This work introduces the empirical cross gramian for square Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output systems as well as the (empirical) joint gramian. Based on the cross gramian, the joint gramian determines, in addition to the Hankel singular values, the parameter identifiability allowing a combined model reduction, concurrently reducing state and parameter spaces.

    "title": "The Phase Transition of Matrix Recovery from Gaussian Measurements Matches the Minimax MSE of Matrix Denoising", 
    "abstract": "Let X_0 be an unknown M by N matrix. In matrix recovery, one takes n < MN linear measurements y_1, ... , y_n of X_0, where y_i = Trace(a_i' X_0) and each a_i is a M by N matrix. For measurement matrices with Gaussian i.i.d entries, it known that if X_0 is of low rank, it is recoverable from just a few measurements. A popular approach for matrix recovery is Nuclear Norm Minimization (NNM): solving the convex optimization problem min ||X||_* subject to y_i=Trace(a_i' X) for all 1<= i<= n, where || . ||_* denotes the nuclear norm, namely, the sum of singular values. Empirical work reveals a phase transition curve, stated in terms of the undersampling fraction \\delta(n,M,N) = n/(MN), rank fraction \\rho=r/N and aspect ratio \\beta=M/N. Specifically, a curve \\delta^* = \\delta^*(\\rho;\\beta) exists such that, if \\delta > \\delta^*(\\rho;\\beta), NNM typically succeeds, while if \\delta < \\delta^*(\\rho;\\beta), it typically fails. An apparently quite different problem is matrix denoising in Gaussian noise, where an unknown M by N matrix X_0 is to be estimated based on direct noisy measurements Y = X_0 + Z, where the matrix Z has iid Gaussian entries. It has been empirically observed that, if X_0 has low rank, it may be recovered quite accurately from the noisy measurement Y. A popular matrix denoising scheme solves the unconstrained optimization problem min || Y - X ||_F^2/2 + \\lambda ||X||_*. When optimally tuned, this scheme achieves the asymptotic minimax MSE, M( \\rho ) = \\lim_{N-> \\infty} \\inf_\\lambda \\sup_{\\rank(X) <= \\rho * N} MSE(X,\\hat{X}_\\lambda). We report extensive experiments showing that the phase transition \\delta^*(\\rho) in the first problem (Matrix Recovery from Gaussian Measurements) coincides with the minimax risk curve M(\\rho) in the second problem (Matrix Denoising in Gaussian Noise): \\delta^*(\\rho) = M(\\rho), for any rank fraction 0 < \\rho < 1. Our experiments considered matrices belonging to two constraint classes: real M by N matrices, of various ranks and aspect ratios, and real symmetric positive semidefinite N by N matrices, of various ranks. Different predictions M(\\rho) of the phase transition location were used in the two different cases, and were validated by the experimental data.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a significant modification to the Random Demodulator (RD) of Tropp et al. for sub-Nyquist sampling of frequency-sparse signals. The modification, termed constrained random demodulator, involves replacing the random waveform, essential to the operation of the RD, with a constrained random waveform that has limits on its switching rate because fast switching waveforms may be hard to generate cleanly. The result is a relaxation on the hardware requirements with a slight, but manageable, decrease in the recovery guarantees. The paper also establishes the importance of properly choosing the statistics of the constrained random waveform. If the power spectrum of the random waveform matches the distribution on the tones of the input signal (i.e., the distribution is proportional to the power spectrum), then recovery of the input signal tones is improved. The theoretical guarantees provided in the paper are validated through extensive numerical simulations and phase transition plots.",

The GMM test framework proposed by Bontemps (2006) to test for the distributional assumption (i.e. the geometric distribution) is applied to the case of the VaR forecasts validity. Using simple J-statistic based on the moments defined by the orthonormal polynomials associated with the geometric distribution, this new approach tackles most of the drawbacks usually associated to duration based backtesting procedures. First, its implementation is extremely easy. Second, it allows for a separate test for unconditional coverage, independence and conditional coverage hypothesis (Christoffersen, 1998). Third, Monte-Carlo simulations show that for realistic sample sizes, our GMM test outperforms traditional duration based test. Besides, we study the consequences of the estimation risk on the duration-based backtesting tests and propose a sub-sampling approach for robust inference derived from Escanciano and Olmo (2009). An empirical application for Nasdaq returns confirms that using GMM test leads to major consequences for the ex-post evaluation of the risk by regulation authorities.",

    "title": "The Optimal Hard Threshold for Singular Values is 4/sqrt(3)", 
    "abstract": "We consider recovery of low-rank matrices from noisy data by hard thresholding of singular values, where singular values below a prescribed threshold \\lambda are set to 0. We study the asymptotic MSE in a framework where the matrix size is large compared to the rank of the matrix to be recovered, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the low-rank piece stays constant. The AMSE-optimal choice of hard threshold, in the case of n-by-n matrix in noise level \\sigma, is simply (4/\\sqrt{3}) \\sqrt{n}\\sigma \\approx 2.309 \\sqrt{n}\\sigma when \\sigma is known, or simply 2.858\\cdot y_{med} when \\sigma is unknown, where y_{med} is the median empirical singular value. For nonsquare m by n matrices with m \\neq n, these thresholding coefficients are replaced with different provided constants. In our asymptotic framework, this thresholding rule adapts to unknown rank and to unknown noise level in an optimal manner: it is always better than hard thresholding at any other value, no matter what the matrix is that we are trying to recover, and is always better than ideal Truncated SVD (TSVD), which truncates at the true rank of the low-rank matrix we are trying to recover. Hard thresholding at the recommended value to recover an n-by-n matrix of rank r guarantees an AMSE at most 3nr\\sigma^2. In comparison, the guarantee provided by TSVD is 5nr\\sigma^2, the guarantee provided by optimally tuned singular value soft thresholding is 6nr\\sigma^2, and the best guarantee achievable by any shrinkage of the data singular values is 2nr\\sigma^2. Empirical evidence shows that these AMSE properties of the 4/\\sqrt{3} thresholding rule remain valid even for relatively small n, and that performance improvement over TSVD and other shrinkage rules is substantial, turning it into the practical hard threshold of choice.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a theoretical and empirical comparison of two popular systemic risk measures - Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) and Delta Conditional Value at Risk (\u0394CoVaR) - that can be estimated using publicly available data. First, we assume that the time-varying correlation completely captures the dependence between firm and market returns. Under this assumption, we derive three analytical results: (i) we show that the MES corresponds to the product of the conditional ES of market returns and the time-varying beta of this institution, (ii) we give an analytical expression of the \u0394CoVaR and show that the CoVaR corresponds to the product of the VaR of the firm's returns and the time-varying linear projection coefficient of the market returns on the firm's returns and (iii) we derive the ratio of the MES to the \u0394CoVaR. Second, we relax this assumption and propose an empirical comparison for a panel of 61 US financial institutions over the period from January 2000 to December 2010. For each measure, we propose a cross-sectional analysis, a time-series comparison and rankings analysis of these institutions based on the two measures.",

The liquidity preference hypothesis predicts higher expected returns for bonds with longer times to maturity; the Capital Asset Pricing Model(CAPM)implies higher expected returns for stocks with higher betas; and standard asset pricing models imply that the pricing kernel is declining in market returns. The full set of implications of monotonicity is generally not exploited in empirical work, however. This paper proposes new and simple ways to test for monotonicity in financial variables and compares the proposed tests with extant alternatives such as t-tests, Bonferroni bounds, and multivariate inequality tests through empirical applications and simulations.",

    "abstract": "Linear Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) models where the innovations could be unconditionally heteroscedastic and serially dependent are considered. The volatility structure is deterministic and quite general, including breaks or trending variances as special cases. In this framework we propose Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Generalized Least Squares (GLS) and Adaptive Least Squares (ALS) procedures. The GLS estimator requires the knowledge of the time-varying variance structure while in the ALS approach the unknown variance is estimated by kernel smoothing with the outer product of the OLS residuals vectors. Different bandwidths for the different cells of the time-varying variance matrix are also allowed. We derive the asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimators for the VAR model coefficients and compare their properties. In particular we show that the ALS estimator is asymptotically equivalent to the infeasible GLS estimator. This asymptotic equivalence is obtained uniformly with respect to the bandwidth(s) in a given range and hence justifies data-driven bandwidth rules. Using these results we build Wald tests for the linear Granger causality in mean which are adapted to VAR processes driven by errors with a non stationary volatility. It is also shown that the commonly used standard Wald test for the linear Granger causality in mean is potentially unreliable in our framework (incorrect level and lower asymptotic power). Monte Carlo and real-data experiments illustrate the use of the different estimation approaches for the analysis of VAR models with time-varying variance innovations.",

Various speci.cations of an augmented production function that allow for endogenous thresholds are considered. The overwhelming outcome is the presence of strong threshold effects in the relationship between output and private and public inputs. Whatever the transition mechanism used, the testing procedures lead to strong rejection of the linearity of this relationship. In particular, the productivity of infrastructure investment generally exhibits some network effects. When the available stock of infrastructure is very low, investment in this sector has the same productivity as non-infrastructure investment. On the contrary, when a minimumnetwork is available, the marginal productivity of infrastructure investment is generally largely greater than the productivity of other investments. Finally, when the main network is achieved, its marginal productivity becomes similar to the productivity of other investment.",

One of our main results is the existence of strong threshold effects in the relationship between output and private and public inputs : whatever the transition mechanism specified, tests strongly reject the linearity assumption. Moreover this model allows cross-country heterogeneity and time instability of the productivity without specification of an ex-ante classification over individuals. Consequently it is posible to give estimates of productivity coefficients for both private and public capital stocks at any time and for each countries in the sample. Finally we proposed estimates of individual time varying elasticities that are much more reasonable than those previously published.",

    "title": "Backtesting Value-at-Risk Accuracy: A Simple New Test", 
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new test of value-at-risk (VAR) validation. Our test exploits the idea that the sequence of VAR violations (hit function) \u2013 taking value 1 - \u03b1 if there is a violation, and -\u03b1 otherwise \u2013 for a nominal coverage rate \u03b1 verifies the properties of a martingale difference if the model used to quantify risk is adequate (Berkowitz et al., 2005). More precisely, we use the multivariate portmanteau statistic of Li and McLeod (1981), an extension to the multivariate framework of the test of Box and Pierce (1970), to jointly test the absence of autocorrelation in the vector of hit sequences for various coverage rates considered relevant for the management of extreme risks. We show that this shift to a multivariate dimension appreciably improves the power properties of the VAR validation test for reasonable sample sizes.",

    "title": "How To Evaluate an Early Warning System? Towards a unified Statistical Framework for Assessing Financial Crises Forecasting Methods", 
    "abstract": "This paper proposes an original and unified toolbox to evaluate financial crisis Early Warning Systems (EWS). It presents four main advantages. First, it is a model-free method which can be used to asses the forecasts issued from different EWS (probit, logit, markov switching models, or combinations of models). Second, this toolbox can be applied to any type of crisis EWS (currency, banking, sovereign debt, etc.). Third, it does not only provide various criteria to evaluate the (absolute) validity of EWS forecasts but also proposes some tests to compare the relative performance of alternative EWS. Fourth, our toolbox can be used to evaluate both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts. Applied to a logit model for twelve emerging countries we show that the yield spread is a key variable for predicting currency crises exclusively for South-Asian countries. Besides, the optimal cut-off correctly allows us to identify now on average more than 2/3 of the crisis and calm periods.",

Based on GDP per capita, the measure incorporates corrections for international flows of income, labor, risk of unemployment, healthy life expectancy, household demography and inequalities. The method for comparing populations that differ in some non-income dimension consists of computing the equivalent variation of income that would make each population indifferent between its current situation and a reference situation with respect to the non-income dimension. This is applied to 24 OECD countries. The obtained ranking of countries differs substantially from the GDP ranking.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a parsimonious and yet exible nonnegative semi-parametric model to forecast financial volatility. The new model extends the linear nonnegative autoregressive model of Barndor-Nielsen & Shephard (2001) and Nielsen & Shephard (2003) by way of a power transformation. It is semiparametric in the sense that the distributional form of its error component is left unspecified. The statistical properties of the model are discussed and a novel estimation method is proposed. Asymptotic properties are established for the new estimation method. Simulation studies validate the new estimation method. The out-of-sample performance of the proposed model is evaluated against a number of standard methods, using data on S&P 500 monthly realized volatilities. The competing models include the exponential smoothing method, a linear AR(1) model, a log-linear AR(1) model, and two long-memory ARFIMA models. Various loss functions are utilized to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the alternative methods. It is found that the new model generally produces highly competitive forecasts.",

    "abstract": "The use of a joint normal distribution for partworths is computationally attractive, particularly with Bayesian MCMC procedures, and yet is unrealistic for any attribute whose partworth is logically bounded (e.g., is necessarily positive or cannot be unboundedly large). A mixed logit is specified with partworths that are transformations of normally distributed terms, where the transformation induces bounds; examples include censored normals, log-normals, and SB distributions which are bounded on both sides. The model retains the computational advantages of joint normals while providing greater flexibility for the distributions of correlated partworths. The method is applied to data on customers\u2019 choice among vehicles in stated choice experiments. The flexibility that the transformations allow is found to greatly improve the model, both in terms of fit and plausibility, without appreciably increasing the computational burden.",

    "abstract": "Risk exposures are typically quantified in terms of a \"Value at Risk\" (VaR) estimate. A VaR estimate corresponds to a specific critical value of a portfolio's potential one-day profit and loss probability distribution. Given their function both as internal risk management tools and as potential regulatory measures of risk exposure, it is important to quantify the accuracy of an institution's VaR estimates. This study shows that the formal statistical procedures that would typically be used in performance-based VaR verification tests require large samples to produce a reliable assessment of a model's accuracy in predicting the size and likelihood of very low probability events. Verification test statistics based on historical trading profits and losses have very poor power in small samples, so it does not appear possible for a bank or its supervisor to verify the accuracy of a VaR estimate unless many years of performance data are available. Historical simulation-based verification test statistics also require long samples to generate accurate results: Estimates of 0.01 critical values exhibit substantial errors even in samples as large as ten years of daily data.",

The new method is simple to use and requires no assumptions stronger than those made by Connor and Korajczyk. It is demonstrated through simulations and analysis of actual stock market data that allowing heteroskedasticity sometimes improves the quality of the extracted factors quite dramatically. Over the period from 1989 to 1993, for example, a single factor extracted using the Connor and Korajczyk method explains only 8.2% of the variation of the CRSP value-weighted index, while the factor extracted allowing heteroskedasticity explains 57.3%. Accounting for heteroskedasticity is also important for tests of the APT, with p-values sometimes depending strongly on the factor extraction method used.",

A stochastic representation of the distribution is also given.

The code relies on 2 series (optionally, 3 series and the choice nested/non nested models). The first one is the observed crisis (binary, taking the values of 0 and 1). The second one is a series of probabilities issued from any type of EWS. Another series of probabilities (a 2nd EWS) must be provided if 2 EWS are to be compared."

Based on GDP per capita, the measure incorporates corrections for international flows of income, labor, risk of unemployment, healthy life expectancy, household demography and inequalities. The code displays the GDP per capita, the GDP relative position and the GDP ranking, the absolute value of each correction in dollar terms (per capita), the relative position of countries after each correction and the ranking of countries after each cumulative correction.

This model uses the Box-Cox power transformation to induce normality and reduce heteroskedasticity. The persistence parameters are estimated in a two-stage procedure based on extreme-value theory, while the distributional form of the error is unspecified. Out of sample evaluation criteria of the model forecasting abilities are included. The code requires a series of realized volatility and a cut-off point (the last observation used to fit the model for the first forecast). The user can choose between the fixed, rolling and recursive schemes. The computations may take some time."
