    "content": "<blockquote>\r\n <p><i class=\"icon-quote-left\">An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not\r\n    the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The\r\n    actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the\r\n    complete set of instructions which generated the figures.</i><i class=\"icon-quote-right\"></i></p>\r\n\r\n    <cite>D. Donoho</cite>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n \r\n<p>With <font color=\"green\"><b>ResearchCompendia</b></font> we provide the tools to publish this \"actual scholarship\" by hosting data, code, and methods in a form that is accessible, trackable, and persistent.\r\n\r\nIt has been a long held principle of academic science that all respectable\r\nresearch must be <b>reproducible.</b>  As such, authors of published research have\r\nhistorically been expected to <b>archive</b> and <b>share</b> the data used to obtain to\r\ntheir conclusions.  Now that much of that data and analysis is generated\r\ncomputationally, it is natural to expect that code and parameters also be\r\nshared.  Additionally, it is right to expect that researchers ought to <b>document</b>\r\nthe computational portions of their research methods as thoroughly as they\r\nwould document a tabletop experiment.<p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><i class=\"icon-quote-left\">We introduce the concept of a compendium as both\r\na container for the different elements that make up the document and its\r\ncomputations (i.e. text, code, data,...), and as a means for distributing,\r\nmanaging and updating the collection.\u201d</i><i class=\"icon-quote-right\"></i></p>\r\n\r\n<cite>Gentleman, R. and Temple Lang, D. <a href=\"http://biostats.bepress.com/bioconductor/paper2\">\r\n\"Statistical Analyses and Reproducible Research\"</a> (May 2004). Bioconductor Project Working Papers.\r\n</cite>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>With <font color=\"green\"><b>ResearchCompendia</b></font> we wish to address these issues facing\r\nreproducibility in computational research. We will provide tools to share and\r\narchive the data, codes, documentation, parameters, and environmental settings\r\nlinked with published research all in one place.  Soon, we wish to support the\r\n<b>verification</b> and <b>validation</b> processes by providing for the remote <b>execution</b> of shared codes in our cloud resources, and the <b>visualization</b> of results.  Most of all we wish to make these tools heavily automated, and easy to access and utilize to lessen the exertion\r\nrequired from already overburdened academic researchers in the process of\r\npublishing fully reproducible work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why create a Research Compendium?</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Boost your citation rates and recognition, and get credit for your code in addition to your publications.</li>\r\n<li>Defend your research.</li>\r\n<li>Archive your research and track your computational procedures.</li>\r\n<li>Speed up the process of converting scientific results into productive forces.</li>\r\n<li>Allow others to build on your work in a highly visible and trackable way.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><font color=\"green\"><b>ResearchCompendia</b></font> follows these main objectives:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To provide the tools for researcher to easily communicate all the information necessary to make all publications fully reproducible.</li>\r\n<li>To allow researchers to quickly disseminate the methods of their research. This will considerably increase the potential of citations of scientific papers.</li>\r\n<li>To provide the scientific community with the ability to use the latest scientific computational methods.</li>\r\n<li>To allow members of the academic community to quickly and easily  verify and validate scientific results and to demonstrate their robustness.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>To do this we hope to provide the following tools:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Quick and elegant Compendia Page creation with easy to navigate access to all relevant data, code, documentation, and results, with no coding required by the researcher. [current]</li>\r\n<li>Free data and code hosting. [current]</li>\r\n<li>Executable functionality with easy parameter entry that enables users and contributors alike to run compendia codes in our cloud and obtain requested results in an downloadable file with optional results visualizations for some languages (R, MatLab, etc.).
