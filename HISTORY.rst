First talk! Now that we've had the first talk about this, let's have 1.0.0!

Not a lot of user-facing changes for this release. We've Renamed project ResearchCompendia
from the pre-release *tyler* name, and renamed the repo to go with that.

* We have tagging on creation, but tags are not yet used for search and browsing.
* We have simple text search that searches through authors, title, abstract
* We have a simple compendium creation form with DOI autocompletition.
* We have some prelimary developer docs that discuss contributions and development.
* We have user profile pages so that users can view a list of their compendia.
