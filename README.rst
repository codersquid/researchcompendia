Features
--------

This is a proof of concept; please pardon the mess.

* `home`: this handles the landing page, faq, and similar concerns that don't call for separate apps.
* `members`: this handles member profiles. It's very spare for now.
* `news`: this handles short twitteresque announcements and news. I'll probably dump this app. I just exists to demonstrate quickly something akin to newsfeed on the main page.
* `supportingmaterials`: this handles pages for article companion sites with code and data. It's spare for now. I wanted a generic name so I picked supportingmaterials. what a meh name? I think I'll change it to compendia.

TODOs
+++++

Ultimately this could combine the idea of executable papers and literate
programming with continuous integration.  It could be the webapp that provides
a front end to a set of services that act as a continuous integration system
for researchers.

What are *research compendia*?

  "We introduce the concept of a compendium as a container for one or more
  dynamic documents and the different elements needed when processing them,
  such as code and data. The compendium serves as a means for distributing,
  managing, and updating the collection."

This project's name comes from Rose Tyler, who was the first companion of The
Doctor in the modern reboot. This is a reboot proof of concept for the original
RunMyCode proof of concept, she fits. I also admit I used this naming convention
in honor of my friend @willkg who gives his projects human names.
