Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given. You can contribute in many ways.

Contributing Code
-----------------

Before you get started, remember that it is easier for us to accept pull
requests that are narrow in scope and easy to review. Ideally we want to see
pull requests with a comment that is a logical changeset so plan to work in
this fashion. TODO: define some guidelines for what makes something easy to review.

start working.
